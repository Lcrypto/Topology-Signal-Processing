# Topology Signal Processing as promising direction to Combine Topology, Physics, Information Theory and Machine Learning
This section of the project will include materials and source codes related to Topological (Homology/Cohomology) Signal Processing, as well as its data-driven approaches (including machine learning techniques such as super-resolution deep neural networks, graphical probabilistic models, and tensor contractions) and model-driven approaches (such as topology complex and thickening to smooth manifold optimization).

Below is a simple example implemented in MATLAB that uses a Convolutional Neural Network with 6 layers (conv2d -> relu) for channel estimation. The code can be found at https://github.com/Lcrypto/Topology-Signal-Processing/tree/master/SISO%20Example%20Matlab%206%20Layers%20CNN%2051%20Rbs Matlab 6 Layers CNN 51 Rbs, and it uses a Single Input Single Output (SISO) Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) 5G NR Downlink TDL-C Channel with 51 Resource Blocks (RBs), Delay Spread = 3e-7, Maximum Doppler Shift = 30 Hz, and SNRdB = 7.

Please note that the presentation titled "MMMA-2019_19_8_19_final.pdf" in the "Topology-Signal-Processing" repository on GitHub represents ideas related to Super Resolution Deep Neural Network Wireless Channel Estimation and Sparse Dictionary Optimization for Faster-than-Nyquist Sampling, as well as its connection to topology and machine learning. The presentation was delivered at The 5th International Conference on Matrix Methods In Mathematics and applications (MMMA 2019) in August 2019, and you can find more information about the conference at https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2019/08/the-5th-international-conference-on-matrix-methods-in-mathematics-and-applications/.

Furthermore,  publication titled "Wireless Channels Topology Invariant as Mathematical Foundation of Neural Network Channel Estimation Transfer Learning Properties" adds valuable content to this project. It was presented at the 43rd International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP) in 2020 and published by IEEE Xplore. You can find the paper at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9163528.
