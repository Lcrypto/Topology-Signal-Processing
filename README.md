# Topology Signal Processing as promising direction to Combine Topology, Physics, Information Theory and Machine Learning
Here shall be material und source codes related to Topological(Homology/Cohomology) Signal Processing and it's Data-driven (Machine Learning include Super Resolution Deep Neural Network, Graphical Probabilistic Model, Tensor Contraction) and Model-driven (topology complex and it thickening to smooth manifold optimization) approaches.
