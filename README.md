# Topology Signal Processing as promising direction to Combine Topology, Physics, Information Theory and Machine Learning
Here shall be source codes related to Topological(Homology/Cohomology) Signal Processing and it's Data-driven (Machine Learning include Deep Neural Network, Graphical Probabilistic Model, Tensor Contraction) and Model-driven (topology complex and it thickening to smooth manifold optimization) approaches.




Add my presentation https://github.com/Lcrypto/Topology-Signal-Processing/blob/master/MMMA-2019_19_8_19_final.pdf from The 5th International Conference on Matrix Methods In Mathematics and applications (MMMA 2019) August 2019 https://www.skoltech.ru/en/2019/08/the-5th-international-conference-on-matrix-methods-in-mathematics-and-applications/ which representing idea related to Super Resolution Deep Neural Network Wireless Channel Estimation and Sparse Dictionary Optimization for Faster-than-Nyquist Sampling and it connection to Topology and Machine Learning.
