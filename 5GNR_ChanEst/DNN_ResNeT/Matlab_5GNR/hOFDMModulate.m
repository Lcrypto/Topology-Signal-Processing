%hOFDMModulate 3GPP 5G OFDM modulation
%   [WAVEFORM,INFO] = hOFDMModulate(...) performs OFDM waveform processing
%   on an input resource element grid including IFFT calculation, cyclic
%   prefix insertion and optional windowing or filtering.In addition to
%   basic windowed CP-OFDM, it also supports W-OFDM (CP-OFDM with weighted
%   overlap and add (WOLA)) and F-OFDM (CP-OFDM with filtering) and the
%   windowing or filtering is applied in a cyclic fashion to give a
%   loopable waveform at the output for test and measurement applications.
%   By default, the DC subcarrier is used for data transmission.
%
%   [WAVEFORM,INFO] = hOFDMModulate(GNB,GRID) performs OFDM modulation
%   (optional DC subcarrier insertion, IFFT calculation, cyclic prefix
%   insertion and optional windowing, WOLA or filtering) of the complex
%   symbols in the resource array GRID. GRID is a 3-dimensional array of
%   resource elements for an arbitrary number of OFDM symbols across all
%   configured antenna ports. The antenna planes in GRID are separately
%   OFDM modulated to give the columns of WAVEFORM. Information about the
%   processing numerology is returned in the INFO structure (see <a
%   href="matlab: doc('hOFDMInfo')">hOFDMInfo</a>). If the input symbol
%   grid does not align with 1ms subframes for the associated numerology
%   then the NSymbol parameter should be used to specify the first symbol
%   number associated with the grid data.
%
%   GNB must be a structure including the following fields:
%   NRB               - Number of downlink/uplink resource blocks
%   CyclicPrefix      - Optional. Cyclic prefix length 
%                       ('Normal'(default),'Extended')
%   SubcarrierSpacing - Optional. Subcarrier spacing (kHz) (default 15)
%   NSymbol           - Optional. First symbol number within subframe (default 0)
%   UseDCSubcarrier   - Optional. Transmit data on the DC subcarrier 
%                       ('On'(default),'Off')
%   WaveformType      - Optional. Waveform OFDM type
%                       ('CP-OFDM'(default),'F-OFDM','W-OFDM')
%   Windowing         - Optional. CP-OFDM only. The number of time-domain 
%                       samples over which windowing and overlapping of
%                       OFDM symbols is applied
%   Alpha             - W-OFDM only. Window roll off factor
%   WindowCoeffs      - W-OFDM only. Optional. Windowing function samples
%                       (defaults to root raised cosine window)
%   FilterLength      - F-OFDM only. Number of filter coefficients
%   ToneOffset        - F-OFDM only. Tone offset in subcarriers
%   CyclicExtension   - F-OFDM only. Optional. Cyclically extend the input
%                       for wraparound filtering ('On'(default),'Off')
%
%   Note that GRID need not contain integer multiples of the basic 1ms 
%   subframe grid. Windowing and overlapping or filtering is applied 
%   between all adjacent OFDM symbols, and also, cyclically wraps around 
%   between the first and last symbols. Therefore different overall
%   waveforms will result from the piece-wise concatenation of the output
%   segments (slots, sets of slots, subframes, frames etc) versus
%   concatenation of the input grids before processing. The concatenation
%   of the output segments will have discontinuities at the start/end of
%   each piece of the waveform. Therefore it is recommended that the number
%   of OFDM symbols in the input grid be maximized prior to calling
%   hOFDMModulate. Any use of <a href="matlab: doc('hOFDMDemodulate')">hOFDMDemodulate</a> to recover the resource
%   elements should be time aligned with the individual waveform segments
%   created by hOFDMModulate. If it possible to create a continuous 
%   time-domain output waveform by manually overlapping the grid data at 
%   the input to subsequent function calls. In the case of F-OFDM, it is 
%   also possible to stop the wraparound processing by setting the
%   CyclicExtension parameter to 'Off'.
%
%   [WAVEFORM,INFO] = hOFDMModulate(GNB,GRID,WINDOWING) allows control of
%   the number of windowed and overlapped samples used in the time-domain
%   windowing. This applies to CP-OFDM only.
